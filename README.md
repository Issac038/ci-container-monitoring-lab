# ci-container-monitoring-lab

A small, fully local DevOps stack that wires a single commit all the way to a
running, monitored service:

**commit → CI → container → deploy → dashboard**

The stack contains:

- **app/** — a Node.js + Express service exposing `/`, `/health`, `/metrics` and `/work`
- **Dockerfile** — builds the service image
- **docker-compose.yml** — runs the app, Prometheus and Grafana together
- **prometheus/** — Prometheus scrape configuration
- **grafana/** — provisioned datasource and a "Service Overview" dashboard
- **.github/workflows/ci.yml** — GitHub Actions pipeline (install, test, build, smoke test)

Everything runs locally and for free. No cloud account or billing is required.

## Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (only needed if you want to run tests outside a container)
- `git`, `curl`

## Run the stack

```bash
docker compose up -d          # build + start app, Prometheus, Grafana
docker compose ps             # show container status and health
docker compose logs -f app    # follow the application logs
```

Services once up:

| Service     | URL                      |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| App         | http://localhost:8080    |
| Prometheus  | http://localhost:9090    |
| Grafana     | http://localhost:3000    |

Grafana logs in anonymously (admin/admin also works). Open the **Service
Overview** dashboard under the **Lab** folder.

Tear down:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Verify the service

```bash
curl localhost:8080/health     # -> {"status":"ok"}
curl localhost:8080/           # -> service metadata
curl localhost:8080/metrics    # -> Prometheus metrics
```

Check the Prometheus scrape target:

```
http://localhost:9090/targets   # the app target should be UP
```

## Generate sample traffic

```bash
./scripts/generate-traffic.sh                       # defaults to localhost:8080
./scripts/generate-traffic.sh http://localhost:8080 500
```

Then watch the panels in the Grafana **Service Overview** dashboard update.

## Run the tests locally

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm test
```

## GitHub Actions

The workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs automatically on every push and
pull request. It installs dependencies, runs the unit tests, builds the Docker
image and smoke-tests the running container. Watch it under the **Actions** tab
of your fork, or trigger it by pushing a commit / opening a PR.

## Rollback

Releases are tagged in Git. You can inspect history with:

```bash
git log --oneline
git tag
```

To roll a bad release back to a previous version, either revert the offending
commit and redeploy, or rebuild from a previous tag:

```bash
git revert <commit>          # revert a bad release
docker compose up -d --build # redeploy the reverted version
```

## Cloud release mapping

The local flow maps to a no-surprises cloud release as follows:

| Local flow | Google Cloud equivalent |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Build the Docker image | Build the image with Cloud Build |
| Store the image locally | Push it to Artifact Registry |
| `docker compose up -d` | Deploy the image to Cloud Run |
| Prometheus and Grafana | Use Cloud Monitoring dashboards and alerting |

The cloud version would publish an immutable image tag to Artifact Registry,
deploy that tag to Cloud Run, and use Cloud Monitoring to observe request rate,
latency, errors, and service health. This mapping is documentation only; this
repository does not require a cloud account or billing.
